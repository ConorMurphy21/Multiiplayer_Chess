# Multiplayer Chess

<h3>To try out project:</h3><br>
<li>Make sure javafx runtime is properly set up for project.</li>
<li>Start up an instance of serverExe.</li>
<li>Start up two instances of main, one for each player.</li>
 <br>
 
The project is set up to be able to connect different computers, but for now it just assumes that the server is a localhost.
