# Multiplayer_Chess

<h2>To try out project:</h2><br>
<li>Make sure javafx runtime is properly set up for project.</li>
<li>Start up an instance of serverExe.</li>
<li>Start up two instances of main, one for each player.</li>
 
The project is set up to be able to connect different computers, but for now it just assumes that the server is a localhost.
