# Multiplayer_Chess

To try out project:
-Make sure javafx runtime is properly set up for project.
-Start up an instance of serverExe. 
-Start up two instances of main, one for each player.
 
The project is set up to be able to connect different computers, but for now it just assumes that the server is a localhost.
